# PRODIGY_WD_05
Created a web page that fetches weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. This example uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the Fetch API) to achieve this.


Instructions:
Save the HTML code as index.html.
Save the CSS code as styles.css in the same directory.
Save the JavaScript code as script.js in the same directory.
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script.js with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
Open index.html in a web browser to see the weather app in action.
This app will use the browser's geolocation to fetch and display weather information for the user's current location upon loading the page. Users can also input a location to get the weather data for a specific place.
